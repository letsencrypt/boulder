Boulder currently exports stats with both Prometheus and statsd. It is in the
middle of a transition towards Prometheus, with statsd disappearing soon.

Currently, two stat groups in particular are duplicated:

Gostats* is duplicated with the default process-level stats exported by the
Prometheus library.
gRPCClient* are duplicated by the stats generated by the go-grpc-prometheus
package.

When writing dashboards and alerts in the Prometheus world, we should be careful
to avoid these two categories, as they will disappear eventually. As a general
rule, if a stat is available with an all-lowercase name, choose that one, as it
is probably the Prometheus-native version.

In the long run we will want to create most stats using the native Prometheus
stat interface, since it allows us to use add labels to metrics, which is very
useful. For instance, currently our DNS stats distinguish types of queries by
appending the type to the stat name. This would be more natural as a label in
Prometheus.
