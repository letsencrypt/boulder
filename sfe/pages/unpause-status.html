        To obtain a new certificate, re-attempt issuance with your ACME client.
        Future repeated validation failures with no successes will result in
        identifiers being paused again.

    <h1>Some identifiers were unpaused</h1>
    <p>
        We can only unpause a limited number of identifiers for each request ({{
        .Limit }}). There are potentially more identifiers paused for your
        account.
    </p>
    <p>
        To attempt to unpause more identifiers, visit the unpause URL from
        your logs again and click the "Please Unpause My Account" button.
    </p>

    {{ else if and .Successful (eq .Count 0) }}
