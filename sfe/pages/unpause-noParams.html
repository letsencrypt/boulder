        <p>
        There is no action for you to take. This page is intended for
        Subscribers whose accounts have been temporarily restricted from
        requesting new certificates for certain hostnames, following a
        significant number of failed validation attempts without any recent
        successes. If your account was paused, your <a
        href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/">ACME client</a>
        would provide you with a URL to visit to unpause your account.
