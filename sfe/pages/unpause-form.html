    <h1>Action required to unpause your account</h1>
    <p>
        You have been directed to this page because your ACME account (ID: {{
        .AccountID }}) is temporarily restricted from requesting new
        certificates for certain identifiers including, but not limited to, the
        following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        {{ range $identifier := .Idents }}<li>{{ $identifier}}</li>{{ end }}
    </ul>
    <p>
        These identifiers were paused after consistently failing validation
        attempts without any successes over an extended period.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1>Why did this happen?</h1>
    <p>
        This often happens when domain names expire, point to new hosts, or if
        there are issues with the DNS configuration or web server settings.
        These problems prevent your ACME client from successfully
        <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/">validating control over
        the domain</a>, which is necessary for issuing TLS certificates.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section highlight">
    <h1>What can you do?</h1>
    <p>
        Please check the DNS configuration and web server settings for the
        affected identifiers. Ensure they are properly set up to respond to ACME
        challenges. This could include:
    <ul>
        <li>updating DNS records,</li>
        <li>renewing domain registrations, or</li>
        <li>adjusting web server configurations.</li>
    </ul>

    If you use a hosting provider or third-party service for domain management,
    you may need to coordinate with them. If you believe you've fixed the
    underlying issue, consider attempting issuance against our <a
    href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/">staging
    environment</a> to verify your fix.

<div class="section">
    <h1>Ready to unpause?</h1>
    <p>
        If you believe these issues have been addressed, click the button below
        to remove the pause on your account. This action will allow you to
        resume requesting certificates for all affected identifiers associated
        with your account, not just those listed above.
