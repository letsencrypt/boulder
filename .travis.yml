# Only build pushes to the master branch, PRs, and branches beginning with
# `test-`. You should not push branches beginning with `test-` to the
# letsencrypt repository, but this is a convenient way to push branches to your
# own fork of the repostiroy to ensure Travis passes before submitting a PR.
# For instance, you might run:
# git push myremote branchname:test-branchname
branches:

# We require a newer version of docker-compose than is installed by way of the
# "services: docker" directive. Per the travis docs[0] this is best remedied
# with the following `before_install` commands.
# [0]: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/docker/#Using-Docker-Compose
before_install:
  # We install `docker-compose` to $HOME/bin to avoid needing root perms.
  # Afterwards where required we refer to the `docker-compose` binary by
  # absolute path.
  - curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.20.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > $HOME/bin/docker-compose
  - chmod +x $HOME/bin/docker-compose

install:
  - ./test/travis-before-install.sh
  - $HOME/bin/docker-compose pull

script:
  - $HOME/bin/docker-compose run -e BOULDER_CONFIG_DIR="${BOULDER_CONFIG_DIR}" -e RUN="${RUN}" -e TRAVIS="${TRAVIS}" -e TRAVIS_COMMIT="${TRAVIS_COMMIT}" -e TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST="${TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST}" -e TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST="${TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST}" -e TRAVIS_JOB_ID="${TRAVIS_JOB_ID}" -e COVERALLS_TOKEN="${COVERALLS_TOKEN}" boulder ./test.sh
