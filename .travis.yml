# Only build pushes to the master branch, PRs, and branches beginning with
# `test-`. You should not push branches beginning with `test-` to the
# letsencrypt repository, but this is a convenient way to push branches to your
# own fork of the repository to ensure Travis passes before submitting a PR.
# For instance, you might run:
# git push myremote branchname:test-branchname
