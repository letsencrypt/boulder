# Test gRPC credentials

This directory contains a script which generates credentials -- keypairs and  certificates -- for the gRPC services which use mTLS during the Boulder integration tests.

Usage:

```sh
$ ./generate.sh
```

The script will do no work if it detects that credentials have already been generated. Therefore if you modify the generation script, you may need to delete the files it has already generated to prompt it to regenerate them.

This script is invoked by [startservers.py](../startservers.py), to ensure that these credentials are in place before any integration tests run.

The files generated by this script live in this directory, but should be ignored by git thanks to this directory's local .gitignore file.
