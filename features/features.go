// package's global Config.

	IncrementRateLimits bool

	// ServeRenewalInfo exposes the renewalInfo endpoint in the directory and for
	// GET requests. WARNING: This feature is a draft and highly unstable.
	ServeRenewalInfo bool

	// ExpirationMailerUsesJoin enables using a JOIN query in expiration-mailer
	// rather than a SELECT from certificateStatus followed by thousands of
	// one-row SELECTs from certificates.
	ExpirationMailerUsesJoin bool

	// CertCheckerChecksValidations enables an extra query for each certificate
	// checked, to find the relevant authzs. Since this query might be
	// expensive, we gate it behind a feature flag.
	CertCheckerChecksValidations bool

	// CertCheckerRequiresValidations causes cert-checker to fail if the
	// query enabled by CertCheckerChecksValidations didn't find corresponding
	// authorizations.
	CertCheckerRequiresValidations bool

	// AsyncFinalize enables the RA to return approximately immediately from
	// requests to finalize orders. This allows us to take longer getting SCTs,
	// issuing certs, and updating the database; it indirectly reduces the number
	// of issuances that fail due to timeouts during storage. However, it also
	// requires clients to properly implement polling the Order object to wait
	// for the cert URL to appear.
	AsyncFinalize bool

	// DOH enables DNS-over-HTTPS queries for validation
	DOH bool

	// EnforceMultiCAA causes the VA to kick off remote CAA rechecks when true.
	// When false, no remote CAA rechecks will be performed. The primary VA will
	// make a valid/invalid decision with the results.

	// MultipleCertificateProfiles, when enabled, triggers the following
	// behavior:
	//   - SA.NewOrderAndAuthzs: upon receiving a NewOrderRequest with a
	//     `certificateProfileName` value, will add that value to the database's
	//     `orders.certificateProfileName` column. Values in this column are
	//     allowed to be empty.
	MultipleCertificateProfiles bool

	// CheckIdentifiersPaused checks if any of the identifiers in the order are
	// currently paused at NewOrder time. If any are paused, an error is
	// returned to the Subscriber indicating that the order cannot be processed
	// until the paused identifiers are unpaused and the order is resubmitted.
	CheckIdentifiersPaused bool

	// UseKvLimitsForNewOrder when enabled, causes the key-value rate limiter to
	// be the authoritative source of rate limiting information for new-order
	// callers and disables the legacy rate limiting checks.
	//
	// Note: this flag does not disable writes to the certificatesPerName or
	// fqdnSets tables at Finalize time.
	UseKvLimitsForNewOrder bool

	// DisableLegacyLimitWrites when enabled, disables writes to:
	//   - the newOrdersRL table at new-order time, and
	//   - the certificatesPerName table at finalize time.

	// This flag should only be used in conjunction with UseKvLimitsForNewOrder.
	DisableLegacyLimitWrites bool

	// PropagateCancels controls whether the WFE and ocsp-responder allows
	// cancellation of an inbound request to cancel downstream gRPC and other
	// queries. In practice, cancellation of an inbound request is achieved by
	// Nginx closing the connection on which the request was happening. This may
	// help shed load in overcapacity situations. However, note that in-progress
	// database queries (for instance, in the SA) are not cancelled. Database
	// queries waiting for an available connection may be cancelled.
	PropagateCancels bool

	// InsertAuthzsIndividually causes the SA's NewOrderAndAuthzs method to
	// create each new authz one at a time, rather than using MultiInserter.
	// Although this is expected to be a performance penalty, it is necessary to
	// get the AUTO_INCREMENT ID of each new authz without relying on MariaDB's
	// unique "INSERT ... RETURNING" functionality.
	InsertAuthzsIndividually bool

	// AutomaticallyPauseZombieClients configures the RA to automatically track
	// and pause issuance for each (account, hostname) pair that repeatedly
	// fails validation.
	AutomaticallyPauseZombieClients bool

	// NoPendingAuthzReuse causes the RA to only select already-validated authzs
	// to attach to a newly created order. This preserves important client-facing
	// functionality (valid authz reuse) while letting us simplify our code by
	// removing pending authz reuse.
